### Notes

In order to use the icon set labeled `Windows 10` in the configuration options you must have the font `Segoe MDL2 Assets` installed on your system. (Pre-installed on Windows 10.)

Due to licensing it can not be bundled in this repository, but if you're running an older version of Windows that **Google** guy might be able to assist you in finding a copy.
